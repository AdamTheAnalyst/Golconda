# Golconda

Golconda is a client wrapper around the Diamond Model. It is designed to provide clean cli and python interface for working with threat intelligence in the diamond model.

Essentially you can think of Golconda like a headless Threat Intelligence Platform.

## Install

Requires a local MongoDB server before launch.

    $> pip install -r requirements
    $> python setup.py install
    $> gcli

Still a work in progress. Watch this space.
